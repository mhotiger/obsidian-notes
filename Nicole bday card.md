Happy birthday bear
I can’t believe it’s the fourth time I’ve gotten to celebrate your birthday. Every day I see you grow, and I’m so grateful we get to look back at how much we’ve been through to get here, and get to look forward to all the ways you’re going to keep growing. I’m proud of you every day, and I love you more and more each day. Welcome to YOUR Austin Riley year, and your golden year. 
I love you the most ever
Always
Your bear
