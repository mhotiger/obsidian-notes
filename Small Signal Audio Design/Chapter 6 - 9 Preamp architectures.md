Gain stage! Assuming 1vRms out for 150 mV input
we need a gain of 6.7 times or 16.5 dB

To reduce Johnson noise from any resistive components, we need to split the gain stages into two, with the volume control somewhere in the middle. This lets us amplify the noise as little as possible. We just need to figure out how we want to split the gain stages.


# Volume Control
resistance should be as low as possible for the stage driving it.

Just look at page 237.
