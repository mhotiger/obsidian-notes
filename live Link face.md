Need to get the official liev link app on the unreal app store
This links from an iphone camera to stream mocap data to the computer running unreal.

You can record this data and put it into a level sequence onto a keyframed sequence.


Needs to be from an iphone because it uses the lidar sensor in the iphone. 
May not be a good solution for live streaming use in the show. Looks like this also workds just with metahuman, so I'm not sure it may work with custom meshes.
