Tons of tiny chapters to break into

## everyone is a creator- tuning in
Everything is creative and everyone is a creator. The universe acts as creator in every movement and new thing and old thing and death. We ride on its wave of existence, and the more we connect with it the more in tune with the creation well be

## Source
Source is where things flow from and to, and return to source. If an idea comes to you and you don’t use it, it may flow from source to someone else, just because it was that ideas time to come

## Vessel and filter

Your ideas are your vessel, and you receive from source. Your filter decides what to remove from your vessel

What’s in my vessel- how do I tap into what I know that I already know. I need to start writing everything to have it out, and by getting it out, I’ll remember what I know and what I’ve seen and done

## awareness
Awareness is how you notice the sources around you. It’s practiced. It’s always changing, because everything around us is changing. We can be aware in the same way, but can never be aware of the same thing twice. 
Practice figuring out why it’s different. What’s changed, also what’s stayed the same.
A good place to start is great works. Take it in so you can know what’s good. Don’t copy, simply know.
