Link obsidian with git for plain text effectiveness


DONT CHANGE PROCESSES-

In order to do more, you have to have the discipline to do less.

### Ulysses Pact
odysseus wanted to hear the song so he made the crew tie him up so he could hear the sirens without temptation.
Setting yourself up so you wont get distracted or make worse decisions later on. 

Talking doesn't scale and is impermanent. *Write everything down.*
Always document and communicate in text what you said and what you meant immediately. 

Write literally everything down please. 

Programmers are really good at managing a lot of text- we could follow them with all other project management. 

# GIT

Foundational unit is the repo. Use markdown to take quick lightweight notes. Link files together to create hierarchy.
Since it's all text, its portable. You can take it anywhere. 

Git issues- a way to keep track of todos- with multiple members they can be assigned and can have a comment thread. 

Milestones. A group of issues with a deadliine. 

Projects- kanban board for issues- integrateable with milestones. 
*you only need the minimum viable board. Keep your process UNCOMPLEX*

Standup meetings- don't sit. Keep it quick. Work the kanban board right to left. You don't have an issue on the board- you don't talk.
