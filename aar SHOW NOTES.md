## General
Need to get rid of the name logo- or work it in for festival sets in increments

Need to give guitar and bass somewhere to run to. They feel aimless

Risers for drums and keys- 2 8x8. Drums SL and keys SR

Musical direction is really good- they're creating some great moments


[[aar Ideas]]


## Swing Swing
white line art deco content- Name in circle on LED
Seems like guitar and bass have no plan, just running around, with the exception of the swap at 3:00

Lighting programming very simplistic. Just a couple alternating jdc hits. 
Guitar solo at 3:44



## Time travel bit
Intro to the second song- crowd interaction
This bit is good

## My Paper Heart
can we bring an actual glockenspiel for this? even if its mimed

## One More Sad Song
Live cameras- Lets work those into content
Content windows in an old school comosition sketch notebook. Lyric animation?
Sax solo in the bridge- Keys player down center with a mullet and sunglasses
Clap break


## Beekeeper's Daughter
