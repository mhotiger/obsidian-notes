second watch


The police Chase is cyclical, so is the atom bomb testing
We see repetitions from beginning to end. Might be a palindrome?


Girls names-
Andromeda, tandoor?, Cassiopeia 

Some phrases are repetitious and circular
1. Going to stay with your grandfather for an indefinite amount of time which has yet to be known how much time that’s going to be
2. General-First I’ll do my speech first which you’ll also receive in a folio form “that was life” his speech has parts that aren’t chapters, and parts that are. Seemingly totally disconnected and unimportant things, but important to him. Life moves on.
3.

1. atomic bomb test 1
2. Midge sitting at the cafe. He never asks permission
3. Midge in the bathroom- after was I ever there monologue
4. The alien



Augie is trapped in a loop post his wife’s death and is unsure how to move forward with his life, so his sentences loop when he thinks about it. 
Why does he burn his hand on the griddle? Maybe he was looking for an excuse to why his heart was beating so fast


All the awards given to the students are stages of star death- and they talk about how on his mothers death she became part of the stars. The stars represent death


For the do you dare me kid everything is an experiment. Including the personality experiment for Woodrow. He’s not intimidated he’s just shy. Callback to the monologue for augie to get the part- “your mother wasn’t shy, you’ll grow to that”

“Was I ever there” midge Campbell monologue. Questions reality and enforced the idea of moving on with life after tragedy or trauma. Immediately “sometimes they sometimes do a stunt double” and photo. Midge also won’t be there very soon- she’s fleeting in augies life as her character is.

It’s important the girls names are stars because they’re the ones trying to bring their mother back to life. She’s apart of them as she’s now apart of the stars



Ellipses is celestial flirtation- twice every 57 years. The catch is the math doesn’t work. It happens even though it doesn’t make sense. It Carries on periodically without reason


The alien doesn’t speak. He arrives slowly and cautiously, and removes the city’s namesake and reason for existing. It’s the same with augie,


Act 3 scene 5- make midge say the line after she closes the door. Then directors wife leaves him, and says goodbye for the last time after she closes the door

Woodrow’s mom couldn’t remember the stars names so she made them up- now she is one. I’m contrast, midge IS a star, and actually has a star named after her. She’s more concerned with stardom than actual stars- wanting things of fleeting life rather than anything that lasts. No concern for what happens after death maybe? 
Reflected in the next scene when she recounts how she isn’t connected to her husbands or children. 


When they’re in the observatory, they both say they’d feel more at home outside the atmosphere, maybe that they don’t belong alive?? 

“All my pictures come out” midge asks if the photo came out- doesn’t care about the alien one only herself

Do you dare me- what’s the CAUSE what’s the MEANING- I don’t know, maybe it’s because I’m afraid otherwise no one else will notice my existence in the universe.
