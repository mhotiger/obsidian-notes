second watch


The police Chase is cyclical, so is the atom bomb testing
We see repetitions from beginning to end. Might be a palindrome?


Girls names-
Andromeda, tandoor?, Cassiopeia 

Some phrases are repetitious and circular
1. Going to stay with your grandfather for an indefinite amount of time which has yet to be known how much time that’s going to be
2. General-First I’ll do my speech first which you’ll also receive in a folio form “that was life” his speech has parts that aren’t chapters, and parts that are. Seemingly totally disconnected and unimportant things, but important to him. Life moves on.
3.

1. atomic bomb test 1
2. Midge sitting at the cafe. He never asks permission
3. Midge in the bathroom- after was I ever there monologue
4. The alien



Augie is trapped in a loop post his wife’s death and is unsure how to move forward with his life, so his sentences loop when he thinks about it. 
Why does he burn his hand on the griddle? Maybe he was looking for an excuse to why his heart was beating so fast


All the awards given to the students are stages of star death- and they talk about how on his mothers death she became part of the stars. The stars represent death


For the do you dare me kid everything is an experiment. Including the personality experiment for Woodrow. He’s not intimidated he’s just shy. Callback to the monologue for augie to get the part- “your mother wasn’t shy, you’ll grow to that”

“Was I ever there” midge Campbell monologue. Questions reality and enforced the idea of moving on with life after tragedy or trauma. Immediately “sometimes they sometimes do a stunt double” and photo. Midge also won’t be there very soon- she’s fleeting in augies life as her character is.

It’s important the girls names are stars because they’re the ones trying to bring their mother back to life. She’s apart of them as she’s now apart of the stars



Ellipses is celestial flirtation- twice every 57 years. The catch is the math doesn’t work. It happens even though it doesn’t make sense. It Carries on periodically without reason


The alien doesn’t speak. He arrives slowly and cautiously, and removes the city’s namesake and reason for existing. It’s the same with augie,


Act 3 scene 5- make midge say the line after she closes the door. Then directors wife leaves him, and says goodbye for the last time after she closes the door

Woodrow’s mom couldn’t remember the stars names so she made them up- now she is one. I’m contrast, midge IS a star, and actually has a star named after her. She’s more concerned with stardom than actual stars- wanting things of fleeting life rather than anything that lasts. No concern for what happens after death maybe? 
Reflected in the next scene when she recounts how she isn’t connected to her husbands or children. 


When they’re in the observatory, they both say they’d feel more at home outside the atmosphere, maybe that they don’t belong alive?? 

“All my pictures come out” midge asks if the photo came out- doesn’t care about the alien one only herself

Do you dare me- what’s the CAUSE what’s the MEANING- I don’t know, maybe it’s because I’m afraid otherwise no one else will notice my existence in the universe. 

Woordrow “how can you think about this the world will never be the same again, what happens next nobody knows!
Nobody knows repeats, what’s the meaning of life maybe there is one!

He yells at augie “you took his picture” saying the thing he did could be important, he replies I’m a photographer. It’s just what he does. It’s how he copes with life- pushes forward with just what is and what should be, not taking time to examine what’s happening around him. 

In the scene where Woodrow asks augie is he was going to abandon them- the auto shop has text that says clear vision with a rear view mirror. Maybe the palindrome theory was right? If so we’re already on the reverse end. The peak is the alien arriving possibly

All the cast is lulled to sleep- is this whole thing a dream? Or is it real?
What’s the play about - infinity

Sleep- it’s not death. It’s not becoming stars, it’s active. Be inert, then dream. 

Everything’s connected but nothings working


Another augie photo that he didn’t take in the play- self portrait with shrapnel. Meanwhile midge is laying in the tub with a bottle of pills spilled beside her- as she mentioned earlier. This is how they both see themselves. Her as already dead and him as wounded but still alive. He asks “is she a ghost” about her character. Did she even exist?

My daughter saw us- Dinah saw augie and midge through the window and admitted everything. This isn’t the beginning of something. Unless maybe it is.
Alien looked at us like we’re doomed. Maybe we are: then he burns his hand.
Why? It’s not clear. You really did it, that actually happened. 
These are two contrasting “it isn’t clear” moments. For midge- the it isn’t clear is whether she’s a ghost or not. Is she alive or dead, was she there at all, is anything fleeting real? It seems she probably is with the “my mom IS a star@ comment made earlier. So we should see midge as an allegory of his late wife? Maybe returning to him, or representing the idea that the people who die never leave us. Which is in direct contradiction with what we know of midge so far, that she represents things fleeting. 

For augie it’s the opposite. He sees himself as wounded, but never dead. The more he’s wounded the more he keeps on going, and maybe it’s by virtue of his disconnection to himself. 
Augie an midge represent the ideas of disconnection and opposing ideas of continuation. He continues on, wounded, while midge doesn’t ever continue, and is dead (part of the stars, maybe she’s a ghost) it’s not clear if she’s actually dead- but what is clear is augie is ACTUALLY wounded. He has the shrapnel scar and then burns his hand (followed by midge “you actually did that”)


What’s the point of projecting a star on the moon? Why take something celestial and bring it down to something terrestrial.
