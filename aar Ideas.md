## Composition Book
Stricture the show as an old composition notebook- Everything is derived from small sketches, and things in the songs come to life from the pages. Think take on me music video

This would be how we could incorporate the band name on screen if they really need that. Keep it on a separate layer to bring it in and out for headline vs festival shows

Utilize video and perspective to make it look like things are coming out of the pages at the audience. 

Need to create a riser structure they can move across and position themselves on. Maybe this is clad in video and creates the actual pages?
Would need a general down wash very even over everything to make the video look like a book and not a screen. Stage has to stay somewhat lit or the illusion breaks down. 


Time machine idea- Have the risers spin and on the backside its a row of high school lockers. Have the locker doors on automation so they open and close revealing lights behind.
