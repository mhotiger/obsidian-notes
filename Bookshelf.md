 Charcoal and authentic 2


Hinges- Blum 71b3750

inset side panels- put a shim underneath the face plate of the doweling jig the same thickness of the reveal I want on the sides 


Hall effect sensor in the bottom stretcher and a magnet in the bottom of the door
Face frame on the front edge of the shelf

Front edge of plywood shelving flush with back side of supports

I need ot figure out a way for the cable to be hidden inside of the front right main leg-
Route a channel in it for the cable to run through and then use a veneer or something similar to top it? Might need some thin kind of Hard board or something OH steal the piece from adam's nightstand boxes, and actually veneer it. 
Will need to cut in into thin strips. I can attach it with magnets I think. The channel will need to be at least as deep as the hardboard plus two magnets.   Glue the magnets onto each strip and then embed a magnet into the leg, just deep enough that the two magnets will meet up and land the veneer flush with the leg. 



Create a recess in the top and bottom stringer for a door stop
