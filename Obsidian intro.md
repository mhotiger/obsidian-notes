It seems the way obsidian works best is with short concise notes that are all links


Each [[idea]] can be granular, or kind of build into bigger things.

### Functions
new note: ctrl N
new note in a new pane: ctrl shift N

new folder: no shortcut? is it available in the command palete?

to create an internal link: double square brackets. It will automatically create a new note that's empty.

Tags- like hashtags. Good for search- seems to be a lot of differing opinions on how to use this best. 
You can drag and drop images. 

ctrl + e: swap between edit and view mode. 

### Style

Heading levels are with a #
bold: double asterisk
Quote: 
> This is a quote

Add a divider with triple dash

---
