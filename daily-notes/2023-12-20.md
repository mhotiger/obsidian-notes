## LOG

Had to sort out invoices for Andy today. I never had a clear agreement with them on getting paid for rehearsal days, so they pushed back and didn’t want to pay it at all. 
I ended up being able to talk with cooper and we made a compromise, but I can’t believe I didn’t ever actually get it in writing. I did so much work and didn’t ensure I’d actually get paid for it. It’s so stupid. I need to have a system set up to make sure I do invoices on time, and send contracts for work done.

Steps I need to take:
Form an llc [[llc ideas]]
Contact a lawyer to get a contract template written up. 
Find a system for making a project board that gives myself clear deadlines. Maybe I can set up something like that for calendar/obsidian? [[Project setup process planning]]
