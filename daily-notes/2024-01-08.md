## LOG


Heard back from megan about resume for AAR today- and asked for it by EOD. I was able ot get my resume together and put together a ton of photos from projects, I'm pretty happy with it, but now I need to finish the creative deck and Continue working on the branding guidelines. 

Goals: Finish brand guidelines by wednesday. I can't underestimate how long the logo is going to take. It'll probably be at least 4 to 6 hours. 

Keep going on the creative deck. Get some mock up and sample cads drawn in. Start with a 40x60 stage and then go from there- assume it's a shed tour until you know otherwise. Include content frames and photos of shows. Add a second version for festivals on a festival stage. Look at cassius deck to get inspo on how to lay them out and photoshop in details. 
This will take a full week if I work a lot on it. I can't let myself get too distracted. Going to layout deadlines in the daily notes for this week.
