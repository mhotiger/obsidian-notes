Got a lot accomplished today it feels like. 
Dropped my car off for service, got nicoles tag updated, ran some errands for her, and had lunch with her mom and saw mary for a few. 

Felt oddly disconnected at lunch today with her mom, but it was kind of nice. It felt like I couldn't focus on them, and then Tim called and I helped him tech an issue for a while. Altogether felt like I wasn't there a ton. 
Helped nicole pack for the new york trip for a long time, and its always tough helping her decide what to wear. Packing lists are hard- it feels like everything she tries on she doesn't like, even if its exactly as she described envisioning it. I want to try to help her get to that vision but I don't always know how, and I get frustrated with it. I wish I didn't get frustrated at her for it, but it feels like that's where it usually ends up, even if just a little. We both get worn out over it relatively quickly and have to put it away for the night.

Finally got this app set up to work with git, so I';m hoping to make notes like this much more often, and get it set up for my phone to work with it quickly and easily as well.
