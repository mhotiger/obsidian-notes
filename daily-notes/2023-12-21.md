## LOG

seems like ian maybe has a large gig he wants to put me on, but won't tell me what it is. I don't think I can get out of india, and I don't think I want to. Maybe someone could cover for me on the new one.
Do I even want to take on the new one? I don't know if I'd rather take time at home. But I'm worried about having an even slower year this time than last year. GA will be busy, but only for half of the year. If I don't get any design work It'll be a pretty low year. 

Put together an excel sheet and sent to stu to outline the amount I'm still owed. They paid the 3 unpaid days from aus, but listed them as from japan(?) but also added one extra day. They haven't corrected the rate error from the beginning and back paid for that. I wonder if they realized that was the issue- that I wasn't being paid enough for the first part of that tour.
