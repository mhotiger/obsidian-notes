Took car in for service today- needs battery, brakes, brake fluid, oil.
Car is throwing a turbo error, but shop seems to think its related to battery voltage being too low like I thought as well. 
They won't replace brake pads without rotors, Dad thinks this isn't normal, but they won't do the repair without it and I need it done. So I guess I'll have to pay for it. It's an extra 250. 


Computer battery is really bad now. Looking into replacing it.
