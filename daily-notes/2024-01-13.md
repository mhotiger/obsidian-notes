 - [ ] Freeze chicken (@[[24-01-14]])
 - [ ] Write some notes about vim while using vim




## LOG
Got a new keyboard in and setup today and its absolutely amazing. It feels so smooth and comfortable and fast. I'm going to need to work on accuracy just a little bit with it, but the sound is also so satisfying and smooth. I think it might be helpful to learn vim keybinds for obsidian. I want to know how to work vim in general. (todo: create a few notes ON vim WITH vim)
