Boxes of notes!

## Types of notes

Fleeting Notes
	Quick thoughts
	small epiphany

Literature notes
- Anything you write when consuming content
- books, podcast, movies, etc
- One atomic Idea each
- reword them yourself
- make sure you can find the reference- link to where you got it
-

Permanent Notes
- consolidates fleeting and literature notes
- 1 idea per note. Each note is atomic, and meant to be a small building block. 
- like nasa code
- Assume there's no context. Put all the information on it so it can be read in a vacuum. 
- Connect the notes in the system. Link to the notes they came from. Link to other permanent Notes

# Types of Boxes

Original  way- 2 boxes. One for literature notes, one for permanent notes

This is meant to be a bottom up style- don't create folders of "what" each of them are, just collect them all together. You can link meaning of notes by building up the notes from small ideas. 

Some people only use one box, some organize by time, others by each of the types of boxes.
