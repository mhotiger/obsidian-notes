I have asked Stu to advance a few ethernet lines to the stage everyday. A few things to know.... You will need to sort out with the festival how to get data to the Laser Mirrors. They are all on 1 universe- universe 121. You can come out of an NPU or use festival/house racks.  
  
-The console you’re running from needs to be set to high priority and be master of the session to execute the song macros correctly.  
-TC is set to status call off. There is a refresh TC macro that can be hit to bump status call on and off In case playback has to skip around for some reason.  
-Cue 99 of every sequence has a command to go to the next song macro. When you get a setlist I would populate this to line up correctly and the songs can then auto follow.  
-TC is set to status call off as default. In case things get off or they decide to jump around there is a macro on the x keys labeled “Refresh TC” This will toggle status call on then turn it back off to jump to the correct spot.  
-The songstart macro is set to off anything below page 100. If you need to fix anything or move anything around just be sure to fix above page 100.  
  
OPERATION  
-The all preset labeled “DS Wash” Is what needs to be focused and color corrected for Ari’s key light referencing the “KEY” auras in the layout view.  
-I have a master labeled KEY. All key light should be programmed in and the KEY master should grab the front light only.  
-The side BMFL’s are one of the more important fixtures in this show. I would say these need to be priority that they can fully cover the stage everyday.  
-You will need to color correct the DS fixtures and side bmfl’s to 4800 everyday. The color only needs to be stored into the 4800 color preset as well as the all preset labeled DS Wash.  
-At the intro of the show, Ari will walk on stage with a jeweled helmet, Once he lands at DSC you should manually fire the helmet cue.  
-During the piano portion of the show (the "breathe" macro) he'll sometimes do a different song or do something on acoustic at down center. If he's playing acoustic, toggle on the Dsc acoustic sequence to change the backlight position. Other than that you can sit in either the breathe or steal the show cues.
-If he goes out of order with breathe or steal the show, bring the VX groupmaster downto black the screen curing the transition- the fades between the songs for media servers only work one way. 
-songs with no spots: paranoid, Molly in Mexico, Summer nights- all these are dark saturated keylight
