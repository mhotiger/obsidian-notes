Workflow thinking:

~~Create an all pool that's designated for recipes~~
~~Create window separation for each song like I do with others. (may not be necessary)~~
~~For each song macro, set the current pointer to that point in the recipe all pool.~~


The best way to do this is going to be in the cue recipe lines. 
Syntax:
Assign group x at seq x cue y part 0.z
z is the recpipe line number. 
I'll probably need to keep track of a table of recipe line numbers for most recent, when updating with a same group and preset type, search and replace, and if not found, add a new recipe line and increment the new recipe line number for that cue.
