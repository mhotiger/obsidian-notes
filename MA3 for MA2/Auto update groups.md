This is dealing with grouping fixtures in the patch. You add a fixture with the grouping fixture profile. You can then add fixtures in the patch underneath that grouping dropdown.

Down is our friend here again. Down opens the contnt of any grouping or instance fixture. 
You can automate your daily group updates by patching house fixtures in the grouping fixture, so every day you do the same grouping fixture, hit down, and store into the correct group. Very easy to create a macro based on this idea.
