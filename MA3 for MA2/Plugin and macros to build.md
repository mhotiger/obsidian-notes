Macros and plugins I need to build:
Finish store as recipe: filters implemented

# Undo
Needs to take the recipes in the programmer recipe lines and re-activate them. Respect filters, and only pull out the ones that the filter allows. Leave the rest of the recipes in the programmer recipe parts. 

# Clean Cue
Go through a cue's recipes and remove things that are duplicates. 

# Matricks
need a plugin for setting matricks. again 1 for x, 2 for y, 3 for z. Could do this with a single plugin and a variable set in the macro. 

# Store macros
Need a store cue x (cue only and remove variants as well)
need to figure out how [[Recipes]] work with tracking. Do they operate as cue only?

Blocking macros, as pool objects under the track sheet.
